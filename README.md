This project is completed as part of Task 02 of my UI/UX Design Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The task involved creating a Dark Mode Mobile News App UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, built entirely in a single HTML file.

The goal was to design a clean, modern interface and implement a functional Dark Mode Toggle that enhances accessibility and improves user comfort during night-time browsing.
